# Reimplementing the Coreutils in a modern language

## (Rust, not C++)

---

# Who am I ?

Debian developer, LLVM/Clang contributor, and other things.

Director at Mozilla (but this work is unrelated to Mozilla).

And been managing some

developers but also worked next to Rust core developers.

---

# Who am I ? (bis)

I also uploaded the initial version of Rustc in Debian/Ubuntu.

And maintainer of ripgrep, fd and some others Rust based packages in Debian/Ubuntu.

# What about the Coreutils ?

I have always been curious to see how it works.

Even if I am terrible with ASM...

## Good news

There is almost no ASM in the GNU/coreutils (besides a few lines in src/longlong.h).

# What the point ?

Well, it is a good question

---

# What the point ?
TODO - split

Well, it is a good question

1. Why not?

2. Rust rocks.

3. It is NOT about security<br />
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/coreutils<br />
Only 17 CVE in GNU/Coreutils since 2003

4. It is NOT about license (for me at least).<br />
Not interested by the MIT vs GPL debate.

5. It is very interesting.

Mix of ASM (ex: ls.s, ln.s, etc) & C (cp.c, if.c, etc)

# 'New' version in C

Example of code - CLI implementation

```c
// usr/source/s1/chmod.c
        for(m=0; *c; c++) {
                if(*c < '0' || *c > '7') {
                        printf("bad mode\n");
                        exit(1);
                }
                m = (m<<3) | *c - '0';
        }
        for(i=2; i<argc; i++)
                if(chmod(argv[i], m) < 0) {
                        count++;
                        perror(argv[i]);
                }
```

# 'New' version in C

Example of code - chmod function implementation

```c
// usr/sys/ken/sys4.c
chmod()
{
        register *ip;

        if ((ip = owner()) == NULL)
                return;
        ip->i_mode =& ~07777;
        if (u.u_uid)
                u.u_arg[1] =& ~ISVTX;
        ip->i_mode =| u.u_arg[1]&07777;
        ip->i_flag =| IUPD;
        iput(ip);
}
```

# A simple programming language

We take it for granted and rarely think about it but<br />
pipes `|` and redirection `>` are amazing

Quick example:
How would you implement an algorithm to find the 5 most popular words in all Shakespeare books? (with 6 chars or more)

# Fast forward to 2023

About 105 commands in the GNU implementation.

```bash
arch      cut        fold      mkfifo   printenv  split     tsort
base32    date       groups    mknod    printf    stat      tty

chgrp     du         install   nohup    rm        tail      users
chmod     echo       join      nproc    rmdir     tee       vdir
chown     env        kill      numfmt   runcon    test      wc

csplit    fmt        mkdir     pr       sort      truncate
```

Note: grep, find, less, top or watch are NOT part of the coreutils.

# A bunch of different implementations

* GNU's coreutils
* BSD
* Busybox
* Toybox (Android)
* V lang implementation https://github.com/vlang/coreutils
* ... ??? (if you know, please sylvestre@debian.org)


---

# Now, this Rust implementation?

* Started by Jordi Boggiano in 2013 (yeah, before Rust 1.0)

* Found it early 2020, saw that some maintainers were still around helping

* Started to contribute in April 2020 for real and quickly took over

---
# Goal of this implementation?

* Replicate the success of clang - dropped in replacement for GNU's

* Cross platform - support Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, FreeBSD, Fuschia, etc

* Easy to test: `cargo test --features unix` and fast: `finished in 44.29s`

* I don't care but the license is MIT

---

# But why Rust?

* Secure by default for memory mgmt
* Very portable
* Lot of crates (Rust libraries) available
  - Don't have to reimplement the wheel
* Terrific performances
* Very popular language
---
# My Goals

* My goals have been:
  - Be able to boot Debian
  - Install the top 1000 packages
  - Build Firefox, LLVM and the Linux Kernel
  - Package it for Debian & Ubuntu

---
# My Goals

For this, we had to deploy:
* Proper CI (and therefore build system)
* Add code coverage support
* Improve the code coverage results (ie write plenty of tests)
* Plug clippy and rustfmt


Took about a year to be in that state

---

TODO add graph deps

---
# Current status

TODO Add graph GNU and the others

How to run the GNU tests

---

# How do we work?


---

# Biggest finding

It is mostly a wrapper on top of the libc


---



---


# What is next?

* Implement missing options
* Complete the full compatibility with the GNU tools
* Improve performances on some key programs
