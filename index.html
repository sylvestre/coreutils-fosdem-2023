# What about the Coreutils ?

I have always been curious to see how it works.


---


# What the point ?

Well, it is a good question

--

1. Why not?

--

2. Rust rocks.

--

3. It is NOT about security<br />
https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/coreutils<br />
Only 17 CVE in GNU/Coreutils since 2003

--

4. It is NOT about license (for me at least).<br />
Not interested by the MIT vs GPL debate.

--

5. It is very interesting.

# A simple programming language

We take it for granted and rarely think about it but<br />
pipes `|` and redirection `>` are amazing

--

It is kind of the STL for scripting (bash, zsh, etc).

--

Quick example:
How would you implement an algorithm to find the 5 most popular words in all Shakespeare books? (with 6 chars or more)

--

```
$ tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' < shakespeare.txt | tr A-Z a-z | grep -E '^.{6,}$' | sort |
uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 5
```

--

By the way, the results:
```
   1706 should
   1125 father
   1082 exeunt
    952 before
    876 master
```

```

Note: grep, find, less, top or watch are NOT part of the coreutils.

# And plenty of arguments

Example with `cp` and other commands


```bash
$ cp --help    | grep "  -" | wc -l
34

$ chown --help | grep "  -" | wc -l
15

$ ln --help    | grep "  -" | wc -l
16

$ ls --help    | grep "  -" | wc -l
61

# Now, this Rust implementation?

* Started by Jordi Boggiano in 2013 (yeah, before Rust 1.0)

* Found it early 2020, saw that some maintainers were still around helping

* Started to contribute in April 2020 for real and quickly took over

---

# Some stats now

<img src="github-stats.png"   height=50 />

<img src="github-stats-2.png"  height=200 />

---

# Status

* Packaged in most of the <a href="https://uutils.github.io/user/installation.html">linux distros</a>

--

* Used by Apertis

--

* Used by a famous social network via the Yocto project

---

# But why it makes sense to use Rust?

* Secure by default for memory mgmt

--

* Very portable

--

* Terrific performances (more later)

--

* Very popular language (easy to find new contributors)

--

* Lot of crates (Rust libraries) available - Don't have to reimplement the wheel:
  - lscolors - provides the same colors as ls
  - walkdir - recursive operations on the fs (cp, rm, etc)
  - tempfile - generate some temporary files/dirs (mktemp, etc)
  - teminal_size - to know how to display information

--

And very easy to use these crates + most of the time cross platform
---
<img src="graph.png" width="100%"/>

---

# Goal of this implementation?

* Replicate the success of clang - dropped in replacement for GNU's

--

* Cross platform - support Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, FreeBSD, Fuchsia, etc

--

* Easy to test: <b>`cargo test --features unix`</b> and fast: <b>`finished in 44.29s`</b>

--

* I don't care (ie please don't troll me) but the license is MIT

--

* It isn't about fighting the GNU project or the FSF

---
# My Goals


* My initial goals were:

  - Be able to boot Debian


--
  - Install the top 1000 packages


--
  - Build Firefox, LLVM and the Linux Kernel


--
  - Package it for Debian & Ubuntu

--
* Published some <a href="https://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2021/03/09/debian-running-on-rust-coreutils">blog</a> <a href="https://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2022/01/29/an-update-on-rust-coreutils">posts</a> about it


TLDR: it works.

This presentation is done a Debian testing with Firefox running the Rust/coreutils

---
# My Goals (bis)

To achieve, we had to deploy:

--

* Proper CI (and therefore build system) for all supported platforms

--

* Add code coverage support

--

* Improve the code coverage results (ie write plenty of tests)<br />
  Currently <b>84.04%</b>

--

* Plug clippy and rustfmt

--

* Document the various processes

--

Took about a year to be in that state

# Current status

# Current status

Running the GNU testsuite with our binaries:

<img src="gnu-results.png" height=500/>

---

# Now, How do we work?

Our goals are pretty simple: dropped in replacement for the gold standard (GNU's).

Great news: the GNU test suite is amazing and we made it super easy to test with:

```bash
 bash util/run-gnu-test.sh tests/touch/not-owner.sh

```
Will run a GNU's test for touch using the Rust implementation

---

# Remaining work

We have a simple script to list the failing tests:
```bash
python3 util/remaining-gnu-error.py
```

# Collaboration with GNU

We contributed to the GNU implementation:

* Programming issues - <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=50070">chmod reads uninitialized variables</a>

--


* Inconsistencies - <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=49239">Unexpected results with sort -V</a>
--


* Tests improvements - <a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/commit/3564e3a572b64c5384519d735dbbb88690438eae">ls --dired tests</a> or <a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/commit/1ac8630f1eed599e84f5a45f3eb14ae32546ac94">mktemp -t: $TMPDIR has higher priority than -p</a>
--


* Testsuite improvements - <a href="https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/commit/8367b95a13b96b96db93a7339c094f813af877c9">Tests separated in different directories</a>


---


# Dropped in replacement?

Also means output.

Example:

GNU mkdir:

```bash
$ mkdir -p -v a/../b/../c
mkdir: created directory 'a'
mkdir: created directory 'a/../b'
mkdir: created directory 'a/../b/../c'
```

--

and we had
```bash
$ ./target/debug/mkdir -p -v a/../b/../c
./target/debug/mkdir: created directory 'a/../b/../c'
```

# Fuzzing to the rescue?

Fuzzing is great to find bugs. And can be extended with Differential Testing.


--
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_testing">Wikipedia</a>:
<i> a popular software testing technique that attempts to detect bugs, by providing the same input to a series of similar applications (or to different implementations of the same application), and observing differences in their execution.</i>

--

We can check 3 parameters:

--
* stdout

--
* stderr

--
* exit code
---
# Fuzzing to the rescue? - Example

Differential fuzzing between GNU and our implementation of the `expr` command.

--
```
Running test ["expr", "49", "<", "27", "%", "75S"]
Test Type: expr
Input: ["49", "<", "27", "%", "75S"]
Rust stderr: Expected an integer operand
GNU stderr: non-integer argument
Discrepancy detected: stderr differs
Test completed with discrepancies for expr: ["49", "<", "27", "%", "75S"]
```

# Performances ?
---

# Performance

Disclaimer: benchmarking performances is HARD


Some binaries are significantly faster.

--

Example #1:
```
$ hyperfine -r 10 \
 "target/release/coreutils sort -R shakespeare.txt > shakespeare.txt.rand; \
   target/release/coreutils sort shakespeare.txt.rand > /dev/null" \
 "sort -R shakespeare.txt > shakespeare.txt.rand; \
   sort shakespeare.txt > /dev/null"
é
[...]

Summary
  'target/release/coreutils sort -R shakespeare.txt > shakespeare.txt.rand; target/release/coreutils sort shakespeare.txt.rand > /dev/null' ran
    4.63 ± 0.19 times faster than 'sort -R shakespeare.txt > shakespeare.txt.rand; sort shakespeare.txt > /dev/null'
```
4.63 times faster than GNU's

---

# Performance

Example #2:

```
$ bash "Clone Firefox"
$ hyperfine -i --warmup 2 "target/release/coreutils ls -al -R ~/dev/mozilla/mozilla-unified.hg  > /dev/null" "ls -al -R ~/dev/mozilla/mozilla-unified.hg > /dev/null"

[...]

Summary
  'target/release/coreutils ls -al -R ~/dev/mozilla/mozilla-unified.hg  > /dev/null' ran
    1.43 ± 0.15 times faster than 'ls -al -R ~/dev/mozilla/mozilla-unified.hg > /dev/null'
```
1.43 times faster than GNU's

--

Similar result for cp -R

<!--
```
$ hyperfine "rm -rf /tmp/coreutils.git; ./target/release/cp -r ../coreutils.git /tmp" "rm -rf /tmp/coreutils.git; /usr/bin/cp -r ../coreutils.git /tmp"

Summary
  'rm -rf /tmp/coreutils.git; ./target/release/cp -r ../coreutils.git /tmp' ran
    1.47 ± 0.34 times faster than 'rm -rf /tmp/coreutils.git; /usr/bin/cp -r ../coreutils.git /tmp'
```
-->

---
# Performance

To be fair, we can be slower too

Example #3:

```
$ hyperfine "seq 18446744073708551615 18446744073709551615 | factor" \
 "./target/release/coreutils seq 18446744073708551615 18446744073709551615| ./target/release/coreutils factor"

[...]

  'seq 18446744073708551615 18446744073709551615 | factor' ran
    5.08 ± 0.01 times faster than './target/release/coreutils seq 18446744073708551615 18446744073709551615| ./target/release/coreutils factor'
```

# Extending the coreutils



We took the liberty to add extra features like:

* progress bars for cp & mv

--

* b3sum (works like b2sum)

--

* cut `-w` from FreeBSD - <i>separate fields by whitespace (Space and Tab)</i>

---

# What is next?

* Implement missing options in the various binaries

--

* Complete the full compatibility with the GNU tools

--

* Improve performances on some key programs
